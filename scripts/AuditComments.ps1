.SYNOPSIS
Audits the comment files that accompany source files and the sources themselves for stray comments.

.DESCRIPTION
Reads the project configuration from AuditComments.json next to this script, then
performs these actions on every run:
  1. Prints the Result table, one gate per finding kind below.
  2. Prints comment-file line totals for each folder under the source roots.
  3. Prints sources that have no comment file, and comment files that have no source.
  4. Prints comment lines that break the line rules: too many words, a forbidden
     character, or more than one sentence.
  5. Prints in-code comment lines found inside sources, every line of a block comment included.
  6. Prints signature headings that name no identifier of the source they describe.
  7. Prints comment files whose second line holds a hash their source no longer matches, and
     those whose second line holds no hash.
  8. Prints the exempt comment files, which the line rules, headings and hashes skip.
  9. Writes a Markdown report to {report.directory}\{prefix}{version}.md.
 10. Writes the full result as a page to {report.directory}\{prefix}{version}.html.
     The page opens in the default browser unless -NoOpen is given.
The console follows scripts\report.md: widest view first, empty lists left out.
The page holds everything the console and the report hold, plus every comment file read.
It fills the template AuditComments.html next to this script, and works offline.

The second line of every paired comment file reads Hash: `<16 hex digits>`. The digits are
the first 16 of the lowercase SHA-256 of the UTF-8 text of the sources paired to that file,
each with its byte order mark dropped and CRLF or CR turned into LF, joined in ordinal
file-name order. A source edit therefore flags its comment file until a person rereads the
prose and restamps it with StampComment.ps1. Exempt files are skipped, as for headings.

Exempt comment files, listed by path under exempt.comments, belong to the developer alone. Only
the developer edits them, so the audit never judges them: no line rule, heading or hash check
reads them, and StampComment.ps1 refuses them. They still pair with their sources, count in the
folder totals, and print under Exempt comment files. A listed path that does not exist stops the
audit with an error.

Each run keeps the text of every stale comment file in AuditCommentsSnapshot.json next to
this script, once per stale stamp. A later run that finds the file restamped while its prose,
spacing and blank lines aside, still matches that text lists it under Comment files restamped
unrevised, with a capitalized warning. That gate only warns. Its entry clears once the prose
changes, once HEAD carries the new stamp, or once the file is gone. The convention test keeps
its own snapshot, so each side flags only the stale files it saw itself.

A stale hash always fails. A missing hash is backlog from before the stamp existed: its gate
reads WARN in yellow while the count sits at or below ceilings.unstamped, and FAIL above it.
A ceiling above the count is stale and fails, so the ceiling only walks down as files are stamped.

Everything project-specific lives in AuditComments.json. The script itself
carries no project knowledge. Files come from git: tracked and untracked files,
never ignored ones, as in the convention tests. Git is the only external tool required.
Every path prints with forward slashes, and every list keeps the order of the
convention tests: paths under the roots sorted without case, then the root-level files.
A configured root or root-level file that does not exist stops the audit with an error.
An unreadable file is reported once, under Unreadable files, and never as a missing pair.

  }

Pairs map a source suffix to the comment file it expects, where {base} is the
file name with that suffix removed. Longer suffixes are matched first.
Markers are looked for in every file whose extension declares them, paired or not,
except the exempt files and the excluded suffixes. Headings are checked in every
comment file the line rules read, the root-level ones included.

Files lists single sources, relative to the repository root, audited beside the
roots. They report under the (root) folder and are skipped when -SourceRoots is given.

Report.prefix starts the file name of both the Markdown report and the page.

.PARAMETER ConfigPath
Path to the JSON configuration. Defaults to AuditComments.json next to this script.

.PARAMETER SourceRoots
Overrides sources.roots for this run.

.PARAMETER Segments
Overrides report.segments: how many path segments under a root form a folder row.

.PARAMETER MaxWords
Overrides rules.maxWords for this run.

.PARAMETER OutputPath
Overrides the Markdown report path for this run.

.PARAMETER Open
Open the generated Markdown report after the audit finishes.

.PARAMETER NoOpen
Write the page without opening it.

.PARAMETER NoPause
Do not stop at each console page. Paging is also off when output or input is redirected.

.PARAMETER Help
Display this help and exit without running the audit. The alias -? is supported.

# AUDITCOMMENTS - AUDIT GENERATION 21.
# A generation is not a revision count. It names functionality, not edits, so editing one of these
# files is never on its own a reason to raise it. Raise it only when the audited outcome changes.
# A generation names the set of checks the audit applies. Two projects on the same generation audit
# the same things and their reports compare directly, whatever else differs between the files. A check
# added, removed, or changed in what it reports is a new generation; wording, plumbing, and refactoring
# leave it alone. Every audit script shares one generation number with the convention-test settings,
# and each refuses a configuration written at another generation.
# Generation 11: nothing the comment audit reports changes; the number rises with the truth audit,
# which checks that a deportment field reaches no request, keeps one writer, holds no logic and
# treats no engine data.
# Generation 12: nothing the comment audit reports changes; the number rises with the convention tests,
# which bind with no compile error, count chain ceilings in names, count a using or a call on a
# deeper record as a reach, and exempt a contract name only where the type declares the interface.
# Generation 13: nothing this audit reports changes; the number rises with the UI audit, which
# counts every surface markup line that hooks logic into the markup and every surface member
# that is not a constructor.
# Generation 14: nothing this audit reports changes; the number rises with the UI audit, which
# also counts command parameters, member paths and literal tags in surface markup as hooks.
# Generation 15: nothing this audit reports changes; the number rises with the name audit, which
# counts prefix turfs, and the UI audit, which counts pack URIs, scaffold types and contract IDs.
# Generation 16: nothing this audit reports changes; the number rises with the structure audit, whose
# Unsealing kind counts engine types on the public members of sealed Deportment types.
# Generation 17: nothing this audit reports changes; the number rises with the vocabulary revision
# of the UI, object, structure and name audits.
# Generation 18: nothing this audit reports changes; the number rises with the UI audit, whose
# truth detector stops five false findings.
# Generation 19: every paired comment file carries a hash of its sources on its second line. A hash
# its sources no longer match is a finding, and a missing hash is a warning under a falling ceiling.
# Exempt comment files belong to the developer alone, and no line rule, heading or hash check reads them.
# Generation 20: nothing this audit reports changes; the number rises with the UI audit, whose
# Mismatching kind only informs while a driver folder it waits on holds no source.
# Generation 21: nothing this audit reports changes; the number rises with the structure, name and
# UI audits, which gained kinds, and with the new fault audit.

NAME

SYNOPSIS
    Audit comment files and stray in-code comments, and write a Markdown report and a page.

SYNTAX
    AuditComments [-ConfigPath <path>] [-SourceRoots <path[]>] [-Segments <number>]
        [-MaxWords <number>] [-OutputPath <path>] [-Open] [-NoOpen] [-NoPause] [-Help]

CONFIGURATION
    All project-specific values live in AuditComments.json next to the script:
    source roots, comment-file pattern, source-to-comment pairs, excluded
    directory names and suffixes, line rules, in-code comment markers and
    exempt files, exempt comment files, report directory, version file and key, and the report
    file-name prefix. Parameters below override it per run.

PAGE
    Every run writes the full result as a page next to the Markdown report.
    It opens in the default browser unless -NoOpen is given.

CHECKS
    Pairs: every source under the roots and every root-level file needs its
        comment file, and every comment file under the roots needs a source.
    Line rules: every comment line holds one sentence, at most the word
        limit, and none of the forbidden characters.
    In-code comments: every file whose extension declares markers, paired
        or not, carries none, exempt files and excluded suffixes aside.
    Headings: every signature heading names an identifier of its source,
        in every comment file the line rules read.
    Hashes: the second line of every paired comment file is Hash: `<hex>`,
        16 digits of the SHA-256 of its sources' LF-normalized text. A stale
        hash is a finding. A missing hash is a WARN while the count sits at
        or below ceilings.unstamped, a finding above it, and a ceiling above
        the count is stale and a finding. Restamp one file with
        StampComment.ps1 only after rereading its prose.
    Restamps: a file restamped while its prose still matches the text it
        held when stale is a WARN, kept in AuditCommentsSnapshot.json.
    Exempt: the comment files under exempt.comments belong to the developer
        alone. Line rules, headings and hashes skip them, and they are
        listed under Exempt comment files.
    A configured root or root-level file that does not exist, or a failing
    git, stops the audit with an error. Paths print with forward slashes
    in the order of the convention tests.

OPTIONS
    -ConfigPath <path>
        JSON configuration file. Defaults to .\AuditComments.json.

    -SourceRoots <path[]>
        Source directories to audit. Overrides sources.roots.

    -Segments <number>
        Path segments under a root that form a folder row. Overrides
        report.segments. 1 lists projects, 2 lists their first-level folders.

    -MaxWords <number>
        Word limit per comment line. Overrides rules.maxWords.

    -OutputPath <path>
        Markdown report path. By default, the project version is used to
        create a path under report.directory.

    -Open
        Open the generated Markdown report after the audit finishes.

    -NoOpen
        Write the page without opening it.

    -NoPause
        Do not stop at each console page for a key. Off by itself when output
        or input is redirected.

    -Help, -?
        Display this help and exit without running the audit.

EXAMPLES
    AuditComments
