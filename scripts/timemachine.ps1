.SYNOPSIS
    Build and launch the application, either from the current source or a versioned snapshot.
.DESCRIPTION
    With no version, the current working-tree source (the configured project
    file) is published inside <work root>/temp and installed into the selected
    current destination: the build folder, the run folder, or
    snapshots/<current-version>/. It can also mirror the complete publish output
    into snapshots/<version>/ before launching.

    With a version, one ladder is climbed. A snapshot folder already holding
    an executable is launched as it is. Otherwise the commit whose subject
    carries the version is exported inside <work root>/temp, published there,
    and installed into snapshots/<version>/. When no local commit carries it,
    the configured remote is fetched once and the commit looked for again; a
    fetch the remote refuses stops the run with the remote's own words. When
    the exact version exists nowhere reached, the nearest lower version is
    used and announced. -Rebuild skips the snapshot rung so the commit is
    built afresh.

    Every intermediate file, the MSBuild artifacts included, lives under
    <work root>/temp, so two scripts with different work roots never share a
    folder. The temp folder is removed once the install succeeds and kept for
    inspection when it fails.

    The checked-out source tree is never used as build output. A snapshot
    folder keeps every file the publish does not produce.

    Every project-specific value - project file, executable, historical project
    names, runtime, publish properties, folder names, git remote and commit
    subject shape, version file - lives in execution.json. This script carries
    none, so the file is identical in every project at the same generation.
.PARAMETER Version
    Historical major.minor.revision to build. Omit it to use the current working tree.
.PARAMETER CurrentDestination
    Destination for a current-source build, named by its layout key: run
    (default), build, or snapshots, the last meaning snapshots/<current-version>/.
    Ignored for historical versions, which are installed under snapshots/<version>/.
.PARAMETER WorkRoot
    Layout key of the folder whose temp subfolder holds every intermediate file
    of this invocation: run (default) or build.
.PARAMETER MirrorCurrentSnapshot
    Also copy a current-source publish into snapshots/<current-version>/.
.PARAMETER Rebuild
    Build a historical version from its commit even when its snapshot already holds an executable.
.PARAMETER NoLaunch
    Build and install without starting the application.
.PARAMETER Invoker
    Name of the script that delegated here, written into the record. Defaults to timemachine.ps1.
.PARAMETER Help
    Display this help and exit without building or launching. The alias -? is supported.
.EXAMPLE
    timemachine
    Build the current source into the run folder and launch it.
.EXAMPLE
    timemachine -NoLaunch
    Build the current source without launching it.
.EXAMPLE
    timemachine 2.9.9991
    Launch the 2.9.9991 snapshot, building it from its commit first when needed.
.EXAMPLE
    timemachine 2.9.9991 -Rebuild -NoLaunch
    Rebuild the 2.9.9991 snapshot from its commit without launching it.
#>
#requires -Version 5.1
# EXECUTION GENERATION 2 - timemachine.ps1.
# A generation is not a revision count. It names functionality, not edits, so editing one of these
# files is never on its own a reason to raise it. Raise it only when the executed outcome changes.
# A generation names what the family builds, where it installs, and what it launches. Two projects on
# the same generation publish the same way and their folders lay out the same, whatever else differs
# between the files. A publish flag, a destination, a temp isolation rule, or a launch step added,
# removed, or changed is a new generation; wording, plumbing, and refactoring leave it alone.
# Generation 2: the family lives in scripts/ with execution.json beside it and is invoked by bare name
# through the dispatchers install.ps1 installs; current source publishes Release, self-contained, with
# the configured properties into run/, build/, or snapshots/<version>/; a historical version climbs
# the ladder - snapshot executable, local commit, fetched commit, nearest lower - and a commit is
# exported and published into snapshots/<version>/; debug publishes Debug into debug/; when a live
# process runs from the install folder the build goes into an eight-digit slot inside it instead, and
# slots nothing runs from are reaped first; every launch is written to the ledger so stop.ps1 can end
# it; every intermediate file lives under <work root>/temp, removed on success and kept on failure.
# Every project-specific value lives in execution.json, so this file is identical in every project at
# this generation.

SYNOPSIS
    Build and optionally launch the application from current or historical source.

SYNTAX
    timemachine [<version>] [-CurrentDestination <build|run|snapshots>]
        [-WorkRoot <build|run>] [-MirrorCurrentSnapshot] [-Rebuild] [-NoLaunch]
        [-Invoker <script>] [-Help]

OPTIONS
    <version>
        Historical major.minor.revision. Omit for current source. A snapshot
        holding an executable is launched as it is; otherwise the commit
        carrying the version is built, fetching the remote once when needed.
        A version found nowhere falls back to the nearest lower one, announced.

    -CurrentDestination <build|run|snapshots>
        Current-source destination by layout key. Defaults to run; snapshots
        means snapshots/<current-version>/.

    -WorkRoot <build|run>
        Layout key of the folder whose temp subfolder holds every intermediate
        file. Defaults to run.

    -MirrorCurrentSnapshot
        Also copy a current-source publish into its versioned snapshot.

    -Rebuild
        Build a historical version from its commit even when its snapshot
        already holds an executable.

    -NoLaunch
        Build and install without starting the application.

    -Invoker <script>
        Name of the script that delegated here, written into the record.
        Defaults to timemachine.ps1.

    -Help, -?
