.SYNOPSIS
    Build and launch a source snapshot.
.DESCRIPTION
    Delegates to timemachine.ps1 with the run folder as its work root. With no
    version, the current working-tree source is built there, installed with all
    publish dependencies into snapshots/<current-version>/, and launched from
    that folder. With a version, the historical source archive is built the
    same way, installed into snapshots/<version>/, and launched from there. Use
    stable to select the stable version recorded in the version file. Nothing
    runs from the run folder, so a running application never blocks the next build.

    Every project-specific value - folder names, version file, project name -
    lives in execution.json. This script carries none, so the file is identical
    in every project at the same generation.
.PARAMETER Version
    Version to run. Omit it for the current working tree, pass stable to use
    the stable version from the version file, or pass a major.minor.revision value.
.PARAMETER Rebuild
    Build a historical version from its commit even when its snapshot already holds an executable.
.PARAMETER Help
    Display this help and exit without building or launching. The alias -? is supported.
.EXAMPLE
    run
    Build the current working tree and launch it from snapshots/<current-version>/.
.EXAMPLE
    run stable
    Build and launch the source archive identified by the stable version.
.EXAMPLE
    run 2.9.9991
    Build and launch a specific historical source archive.

# EXECUTION GENERATION 2 - run.ps1.
# A generation is not a revision count. It names functionality, not edits, so editing one of these
# files is never on its own a reason to raise it. Raise it only when the executed outcome changes.
# A generation names what the family builds, where it installs, and what it launches. Two projects on
# the same generation publish the same way and their folders lay out the same, whatever else differs
# between the files. A publish flag, a destination, a temp isolation rule, or a launch step added,
# removed, or changed is a new generation; wording, plumbing, and refactoring leave it alone.
# Generation 2: the family lives in scripts/ with execution.json beside it and is invoked by bare name
# through the dispatchers install.ps1 installs; current source publishes Release, self-contained, with
# the configured properties into run/, build/, or snapshots/<version>/; a historical version climbs
# the ladder - snapshot executable, local commit, fetched commit, nearest lower - and a commit is
# exported and published into snapshots/<version>/; debug publishes Debug into debug/; when a live
# process runs from the install folder the build goes into an eight-digit slot inside it instead, and
# slots nothing runs from are reaped first; every launch is written to the ledger so stop.ps1 can end
# it; every intermediate file lives under <work root>/temp, removed on success and kept on failure.
# Every project-specific value lives in execution.json, so this file is identical in every project at
# this generation.
