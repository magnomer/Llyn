.SYNOPSIS
    Install the bare-name dispatchers so every script here runs as a plain command.
.DESCRIPTION
    Writes one small .cmd dispatcher per script in this folder into a folder on the
    user PATH, so typing run, build, stop or any other script name in cmd or
    PowerShell runs the matching script of the nearest project: the dispatcher
    walks up from the current folder until it finds <name>.ps1 in a scripts folder
    or, for a project still keeping its scripts at the root, in the folder itself,
    then runs it with pwsh when present and Windows PowerShell otherwise. The
    dispatchers are byte-identical and name nothing of this project, so one
    installation serves every project on the machine; a dispatcher this project
    has no script for is left alone, since another project may own it.

    A bare name reaches its script in any letter case. Windows finds the
    dispatcher and the script without regard to case, so audit, auditlines,
    auditlineshistory, auditcomments, auditencoding, auditfake, auditnames,
    auditnamesnew, auditobject, auditobjecthistory, auditplatform,
    auditstructure and auditui run Audit.ps1, AuditLines.ps1,
    AuditLinesHistory.ps1, AuditComments.ps1, AuditEncoding.ps1, AuditFake.ps1,
    AuditNames.ps1, AuditNamesNew.ps1, AuditObject.ps1, AuditObjectHistory.ps1,
    AuditPlatform.ps1, AuditStructure.ps1 and AuditUI.ps1.
    The helpers work the same way, for example timemachine and syncnames.
    An older dispatcher file named in another case keeps working and is
    updated in place.

    A script may carry a second name: each "# ALIAS <name>" line in its header
    writes one more dispatcher under that name. An alias dispatcher still runs
    <alias>.ps1 when the nearest project has one, and its script otherwise, so
    detector runs TraceSymbol.ps1 here and detector.ps1 in a project not yet
    renamed.

    The destination folder is created when missing and appended to the user PATH
    when absent; the current session's PATH is updated as well. Consoles already
    open elsewhere see the new PATH only after they are reopened.
.PARAMETER Destination
    Folder the dispatchers are written to. Defaults to bin under the user profile.
.PARAMETER Help
    Display this help and exit without writing anything. The alias -? is supported.
.EXAMPLE
    install
    Install the dispatchers into %USERPROFILE%\bin and put that folder on the PATH.
.EXAMPLE
    install -Destination D:\tools
    Install the dispatchers into D:\tools instead.
