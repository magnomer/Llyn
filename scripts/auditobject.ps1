.SYNOPSIS
Grades every type on a ladder of creature verdicts: merges every partial type and measures
its size, its coupling to other codebase types, the state it rebinds and how tightly its parts
are glued.

.DESCRIPTION
A type split over several partial files can look tidy on disk while the compiler still sees one
object. This audit parses the source with Roslyn, merges the parts of every type, and measures:

  - Parts, Lines and Members of the merged type: its declarations, the lines they span and the
    members they declare. A part is one declaration of the type, so one file may hold several.
    Lines sums the declaration spans, so the lines of a nested type count toward it. Members
    leaves nested types out, since each is merged as its own type. A partial method or property
    counts once, on the part that implements it.
  - Mutable: the slots the type can rebind after construction. These are the fields neither const
    nor readonly, static ones included, and the backed properties with a non-init setter. A
    readonly field of any type, an event, and a get-only or init-only property are not Mutable.
    Known limit: a captured primary-constructor parameter is neither Mutable nor a hub slot,
    though the compiler stores it, since it declares no member of the type.
  - Outgoing: the distinct codebase types the type names, its fan-out. Incoming: the distinct
    codebase types that name it, its fan-in. Both count types, not members or references. A
    codebase type is any class, struct, interface, record, enum or delegate in a walked file.
    Every name counts, so a get-only, init-only or event declaration still adds its type. Names
    inside a nested type belong to it, and a type never uses itself or a type nested in or
    around it.
  - Crossings: member links that cross from one part into another. Density: Crossings per member.
  - Glued: the share of parts the widest component of the member graph spans, members being
    linked by "reads, writes or calls". Fused is the same share once hub state is removed.
  - Shared: the hub slots of the type.

The helper reads the bound sources in three passes. The first registers every part and member,
so a reference bound later finds its target whatever file declares it. The second turns every
simple name in a member body that binds to another member of the same type into an edge from
the enclosing member, never to itself. The third binds every simple name under a type
declaration, nested types excluded, to the codebase types it stands for, which Outgoing and
Incoming count.

Every flag is measured on the merged type, whatever its part count, so a partial split escapes
none. Each flag below is hit when its condition holds with every comparison at the limit or
above. A type keeps every flag it hits. Its verdict is the worst of them, in this order, else
Colony or Hermit:
  Hydra      parts and lines at thresholds.hydra, and fused or density at thresholds.hydra
  Kraken     a Serpent or Centipede that is also an Octopus or Spider, with no threshold of its own
  Spider     outgoing and incoming at thresholds.spider
  Chameleon  mutable at thresholds.chameleon
  Octopus    outgoing at thresholds.octopus
  Centipede  members at thresholds.centipede
  Serpent    lines at thresholds.serpent
  Colony     several parts, no flag
  Hermit     one part, no flag
Kraken joins the size axis (Serpent or Centipede) and the coupling axis (Octopus or Spider).
Mutable stays its own axis, so a Chameleon condition never makes a Kraken.
A hub is a state slot reached from thresholds.hub.parts or more parts, its declaring part
included. It is a finding on the slot, outside the ladder, never a flag or a verdict. A type whose
only finding is a hub stays a Colony, and the verdict table shows each type's hub count. While
enforced is true, the count of every flag and of hubs must stay within its ceiling, and every type
declared in several parts within the part count its row in parts names, an unnamed type holding one.
A ceiling above its count is stale and always fails.

The convention test TAuditObject is the counterpart of this script, and neither reads the other.
On the same tree both report the same results, while presentation is each side's own. The only
allowed difference in results is a config fault. This script throws on any missing key in
auditobject.json, a missing ceiling key included, and refuses a configuration at another
generation. The test reads a missing ceiling key as 0, so that flag's fact fails once the flag
has a hit. A missing limit key throws on both sides.

Binding goes through the shared binder of auditbinder.cs and auditbinder.json: the tracked
sources, the generated code and the host build output, with no compile error allowed. The
solution must be built first. The scope line counts the listed source files the binder walked.
The helper targets helper.framework, the framework of the convention tests, and is compiled
once per text and SDK into the temp folder. The console shows the result, the hits by flag, the
types by verdict, the types declared in several parts, every flagged type with its flags and hubs,
and every hit list. The split, flagged and hit lists are cut at console.top, while the Markdown
report written to {report.directory}\{prefix}{version}.md holds every row.
Console and report number every term by one list: (1) Hydra to (7) Serpent on the ladder,
(8) Hub and (9) Colony. Hermit, the clean state, carries no number.

Everything project-specific lives in auditobject.json next to this script. No project source
is modified. Git and the .NET SDK are required.

.PARAMETER Root
Project root to audit. Defaults to the directory containing this script's parent.

.PARAMETER ReportDirectory
Overrides report.directory for this run. Relative paths resolve against the project root.

.PARAMETER Top
Overrides console.top: how many rows the split, flagged and hit lists show on the console.

.PARAMETER Open
Open the report after the audit finishes.

.PARAMETER NoPause
Do not stop at each console page. Paging is also off when output or input is redirected.

.PARAMETER Help
Display this help and exit. The alias -? is supported.

.EXAMPLE
auditobject
Audit the current checkout.

.EXAMPLE
auditobject -ReportDirectory D:\temp\audit -Top 10 -Open
Write the report elsewhere, show ten rows per list, open the report.

# AUDITOBJECT GENERATION 18 - auditobject.ps1.
# A generation is not a revision count. It names functionality, not edits, so editing one of these
# files is never on its own a reason to raise it. Raise it only when the audited outcome changes.
# A generation names the set of checks the audit applies. Two projects on the same generation audit
# the same things and their reports compare directly, whatever else differs between the files. A check
# added, removed, or changed in what it reports is a new generation; wording, plumbing, and refactoring
# leave it alone. Every audit script shares one generation number with the convention-test settings,
# and each refuses a configuration written at another generation.
# Generation 9 merges partial types, counts parts, lines, members and state, measures shared state
# and cross-part references, and computes member-graph components to grade each split type.
# Generation 11: nothing the object audit reports changes; the number rises with the truth audit,
# which checks that a deportment field reaches no request, keeps one writer, holds no logic and
# treats no engine data.
# Generation 12: the audit applies the rules of the convention test: the monolith rule with hubs and
# density, the hub and large counts, and a part ceiling per split type, bound with no compile error.
# Generation 13: nothing this audit reports changes; the number rises with the UI audit, which
# counts every surface markup line that hooks logic into the markup and every surface member
# that is not a constructor.
# Generation 14: nothing this audit reports changes; the number rises with the UI audit, which
# also counts command parameters, member paths and literal tags in surface markup as hooks.
# Generation 15: nothing this audit reports changes; the number rises with the name audit, which
# counts prefix turfs, and the UI audit, which counts pack URIs, scaffold types and contract IDs.
# Generation 16: nothing this audit reports changes; the number rises with the structure audit, whose
# Unsealing kind counts engine types on the public members of sealed Deportment types.
# Generation 17: findings take one vocabulary of -ing kinds and plain measure names, and the
# configuration keys follow. What the audit counts is unchanged.
# Generation 18: nothing this audit reports changes; the number rises with the UI audit, whose
# truth detector stops five false findings.
