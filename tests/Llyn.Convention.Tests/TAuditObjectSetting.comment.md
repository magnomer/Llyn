# TAuditObjectSetting.cs

## `internal static class TAuditObjectSetting`

Hand-written and tracked: the object-audit switch, the report path, the limits and the ceilings live here.
No script writes this file.
`auditobject.ps1` reads its own auditobject.json and never writes this file.

## `public const bool TAuditObjectEnforced = true;`

False makes every object fact a warning that passes.
True fails a fact when a kind counts above its ceiling.

## `public const string TAuditObjectReport = "temp/audit/Object-{0}.md";`

Where the report lands, with the version in the name.
`temp` is ignored by Git, so a run never dirties the tree.

## `public const int TAuditPartLimit = 5;`

A type declared in fewer files than this is never a monolith.
Raising a limit spares more types, so the ratchet lets each limit only fall.

## `public const int TAuditSpanLimit = 1000;`

A type whose merged declarations hold fewer lines than this is never a monolith.

## `public const int TAuditHubReach = 5;`

A state slot reached from this many parts or more is a hub.
Its declaring part counts as reaching it.

## `public const double TAuditWeaveLimit = 0.75;`

The share of parts the largest member component may span before the parts count as one object.
Hub state is removed before the components are formed, so one shared field alone never weaves a type.

## `public const double TAuditDensityLimit = 0.5;`

Cross-part references per member at which the parts count as one object whatever the weave says.

## `public const int TAuditLargeLines = 500;`

Lines at which a single-part type is large, matching `thresholds.lines` in scripts/auditobject.json.

## `public const int TAuditLargeMembers = 40;`

Members at which a single-part type is large.

## `public const int TAuditLargeState = 12;`

State slots at which a single-part type is large.

## `public static readonly IReadOnlyDictionary<string, int> TAuditObjectCeiling`

The hit count each kind may reach.
`Monolith` counts the split types that are one object behind many files.
`Hub` counts the state slots reached from many parts, over every type.
`Large` counts the single-part types at a large threshold.
A count above fails the fact, a ceiling above the count is stale and fails too.
Lower a ceiling when a type sheds a hit, never raise one to admit a new one.

## `public static readonly IReadOnlyDictionary<string, int> TAuditPartCeiling`

The parts a split type may be spread over, keyed by its full name.
Every split type is listed at its count, and a type not listed may hold one part.
Dropping a row once its type is whole tightens, so the ratchet lets it go.
Lower a ceiling when a plan lifts a part into its own type, never raise one.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditObjectInclude`

The `git ls-files` patterns of the sources the walk compiles.
