# TAuditComment.cs

## `public sealed class TAuditComment`

Keeps prose in the comment files and out of the sources.
Every rule value comes from `TAuditCommentSetting`, which mirrors scripts/auditcomments.json.
The findings match auditcomments.ps1 on the same tree.

## `public void AuditComment_CommentLines_KeepLineRules()`

Reads every comment file under the configured roots, plus those of the listed root-level files.
A blank line is skipped, and a heading loses its `#` marks before it is judged.
Every line must be one sentence, hold at most the configured words, and carry none of the forbidden characters.
A heading counts only its words outside code spans.
Any hit names the file, line, and the rule it breaks.

## `public void AuditComment_Sources_CarryNoRemark()`

Scans every audited source and listed root-level file for the comment markers its extension declares.
String and character literals are blanked first, so a `//` inside a URL does not count.
Every line of an unclosed block comment counts until the line holding its closer.
Files named in the exempt list are skipped, since the generated registry carries a header.

## `public void AuditComment_Sources_CarryCommentFile()`

Checks every configured source and listed root-level file has its paired comment file beside it.
The source list and generated-file exclusions match the script configuration.

## `public void AuditComment_CommentFiles_HaveSource()`

Every comment file under the roots must be the paired comment file of a source.
A comment file left behind by a deleted or renamed source is otherwise never noticed.

## `private static IEnumerable<string> TAuditOwnerRead(string repoRoot)`

Every source that needs a comment file: the paired sources under the roots and the listed root-level files.

## `public void AuditComment_Headings_NameMembers()`

Every signature heading of a comment file names an identifier its source still holds.
The source is the code or markup file the comment file sits beside, all of them when several share it.
A heading that is a markup snippet or a file name is left out.
A heading for a member that was renamed or deleted is otherwise never noticed.

## `private static IReadOnlyList<string> TAuditScanRead(string repoRoot, TAuditScope scope)`

Every tracked file in the scope, read through `TAuditSource`.
An empty scope fails rather than passing vacuously.

## `private static string? TAuditMemberRead(string span)`

The identifier a heading names: the last one before a parameter list, an initializer or a body.
Type arguments are dropped first.

## `private static string TAuditCommentRead(string path)`

Maps `.xaml.cs` to `.xaml.comment.md` and other sources to the matching `.comment.md` name.

## `private static readonly string[] TAuditCodeExtensions`

The files a comment file may describe: its stem itself, a source, a markup file or a code-behind.

## `private static readonly Regex TAuditHeadingPattern`

A second-level heading whose whole text is one code span.

## `private static readonly Regex TAuditFilePattern`

A heading that names a file rather than a member.

## `private static readonly Regex TAuditGenericPattern`

One innermost type argument list, dropped until none is left.

## `private static readonly Regex TAuditIdentifierPattern`

One identifier, verbatim or plain.

## `private static readonly Regex TAuditAbbreviationPattern`

A listed abbreviation with its full stop, which never ends a sentence.

## `private static readonly Regex TAuditLevelPattern`

The `#` marks that open a heading.

## `private static string TAuditLineCheck(string line)`

Returns the rule problems one line breaks, joined by a comma, or an empty string.
A leading list marker is dropped before the words are counted.
Code spans are dropped before the forbidden characters and sentence marks are looked for.
A sentence mark followed by any letter starts a new sentence, unless it closes an abbreviation.

## `private static string[] TAuditSourceRead(string path, bool code)`

Blanks every string literal over the whole file before splitting into lines.
An ordinary string or character literal never crosses a line break.
A verbatim or raw literal spanning lines keeps its line count, so a hit still reports the right line.
