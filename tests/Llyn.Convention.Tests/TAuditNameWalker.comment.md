# TAuditNameWalker.cs

## Generation

AUDITNAMES GENERATION 8.

A generation is not a revision count.
It names functionality, not edits.
Editing this file is never on its own a reason to raise it.
Raise it only when the audited outcome changes.
A generation names the set of checks the audit applies.
Two projects on the same generation audit the same things.
Their reports compare directly, whatever else differs between the files.
A check added, removed, or changed in what it reports is a new generation.
Wording, plumbing, and refactoring leave the generation alone.

This project is one of two implementations that investigate the same names.
Neither shares code with the other, and that is the design.
Both must be at the same generation, so both carry the number.
A disagreement between them is a defect in one, for a person to read.

Generation 8 holds every naming value in `TAuditNameSetting.cs`.
That generated sidecar is one of three here that name a project, one per audit.
Every other file in this project is identical in every project at this generation.
Each sidecar is generated and committed, so this project builds on its own.

Generation 8 checks missing prefix, component count, base registration, and verb ending.
It exempts descriptive test methods under an all-or-nothing test-prefix consistency gate.
It audits a generated name at the declaration it is built from.
It clears a name only through a scoped row of the exempt block.
It does not audit the tooling's own files, and sources reach it through a `TAuditScope`.

## Inline notes

### `if (registry.TAuditExemptValidate(candidate.TSpecimenName, candidate.TSpecimenPath))`

A row of the `AUDIT:EXEMPT` block grants its name only inside the files that row lists.
The same word stays a violation in every other file.
A control template part such as `PART_Track` is registered there with the `*` scope.
Only the user adds a row, and working a report never grants one.

### `if (node is MethodDeclarationSyntax commandMethod)`

A source generator emits a name the source never spells, so the audit builds it here.
A `[RelayCommand]` method yields the `{Name}Command` property that actually exists.
The generated name is a data member and is governed as one.

### `bool anyTestPrefixed = candidates.Any(candidate =>`

The test suite either names every test method descriptively without a prefix.
Otherwise it commits to the T prefix on every one.
A single T-prefixed test method flips the whole suite into the prefix-required mode.

### `if (!anyTestPrefixed)`

A test method carries a free-form scenario description, never an object base or verb.
While no test method uses the T prefix the whole suite is descriptive and exempt.
Once any test method adopts T, every test method must carry it.

### `return "missing required prefix";`

A codebase-owned name that survived the external/generated/framework-contract filters but carries no prefix is a violation, not something to skip.

### `private static bool TAuditContractCheck(SyntaxNode node, string name)`

A member may be a contract member of a framework interface the enclosing type declares.
Such a name is externally fixed by that interface.
That is the same reason an explicit interface implementation is exempt.
The rule is applied here to the implicit form.
For a partial type the interface may be declared in another fragment this file cannot see.
So a contract-member name is accepted on the name alone.
