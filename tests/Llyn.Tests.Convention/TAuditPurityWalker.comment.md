## `internal static class TAuditPurityWalker`

Reads every framework namespace and eavesdropping member a pure ring names.
A namespace is read twice, from the using directive and from the symbol a name binds to.
A package the project references beyond the runtime stays unbound, so its using directive is what is read.

## `private static readonly string TAuditPurityProject`

The project's own namespace prefix, never a framework namespace.

## `public static IReadOnlyList<TAuditHit> TAuditRun()`

Scans each tree of a pure ring on its own thread and returns every hit ordered by file and line.

## `private static List<TAuditHit> TAuditTreeScan(SemanticModel model, string relative, string ring)`

Walks one tree for the names bound to a type outside the sources.
A namespace outside the frame is a `Foraging` hit and a member under an eavesdropping row an `Eavesdropping` hit.
One hit per line, kind and name, so a name used twice on a line counts once.

## `private static bool TAuditOutsideCheck(string ring, string space)`

True when the namespace is not in the shared frame nor the ring's extra frame.
It matches whole, so `System` never admits `System.IO`.

## `private static string? TAuditEavesdroppingRead(ISymbol symbol, INamedTypeSymbol type, string space)`

The eavesdropping row the symbol sits under, or null.
A member appends its own name, so `DateTime.UtcNow` is told apart from `DateTime`.
