## `internal static partial class TAuditTruthWalker`

The misfiring half of the truth walker, covering what the driver's medium may not decide.
`TAuditCarriedNames` caches each member's carried names, keyed by the member node.
A control's state, console input, a clock and a deaf handler count as misfiring.
None of them is a user act or an engine fact.
It also holds the gatekeeping rules for answers a driver branches on.

## `private static void TAuditMisfiringScan(SyntaxNode root, List<TViolation> violations)`

Walks every node of a file for misfiring and reports each once per line, kind and name.
An `if` or ternary whose condition reads a control or console input and whose branch requests lets the medium decide.
A switch case or arm deciding on a control read is the same misfiring, when any section or arm requests.
Every form exempts the same reads, a presence test or an `is` test of type tests alone.
So the verdict never depends on the syntax the author picked.
An `if` that only hears whose event it is decides nothing, so a focus guard is no hit.
An `if` deciding a request on a dialog answer is gatekeeping.
The gate asks the user through a port instead.
An `if`, ternary or switch deciding a request on an engine answer is gatekeeping.
The gate owns that decision.
A clock drives a request through an event, a callback it is built with or a loop that waits.
A method or lambda taking the bulletin type it never reads shows from driver state on a signal it ignored.

## `private static string TAuditExcerptRead(SyntaxNode node)`

The first line of the node, trimmed, as the hit's name.

## `private static bool TAuditAskedCheck(ExpressionSyntax condition)`

True when the condition reads logic, calls logic or calls a driver member that reads logic.
A verdict wrapped in a driver method is still the engine's answer.
A name inside `nameof` is not asked, since it reads no value.

## `private static string? TAuditControlRead(ExpressionSyntax condition)`

The first control a condition reads a member of, or the first console input it calls, or null.
A control is any expression whose type derives from a listed control base.
A member of a control that is itself logic is the path to the engine, not the control's state.
A local or parameter carrying a control read counts as that read, so a carrier hides nothing.
Last comes an `is` test on any value whose type pattern names a control and tests its state.
So `sender is TextBox { Text: "a" }` reads a control although `sender` is typed `object`.

## `private static string? TAuditControlRead(ExpressionSyntax condition, HashSet<ISymbol> carried)`

The same read against a given set of carried names.
The carrier set uses it while the set is still growing.

## `private static HashSet<ISymbol> TAuditCarriedRead(SyntaxNode scope)`

The locals and parameters of one member that carry a control read.
A declaration or assignment whose value reads a control carries it.
An argument that reads a control carries it into the local function's parameter.
The nodes are read in order, so a carrier copied from a carrier carries too.
A designation in a pattern never carries, since a type test pairs a row and reads no state.
A call that takes a control is not a read of it, so its result carries nothing.

## `private static bool TAuditShapeCheck(SyntaxNode node)`

True for a property pattern on a control type that tests more than type.
It is the pattern form of a control read when the tested value is not typed as a control.

## `private static bool TAuditHearingCheck(IfStatementSyntax branch)`

True when an `if` without `else` only drops an event the user did not cause.
This is hearing under JobRule B2, not misfiring, since it picks no gate and decides no data.
An early exit qualifies when its body is a bare `return` and its condition negates a focus guard.
Any other `if` qualifies when its condition is a focus guard and no request follows it in the member.
So the false path drops the event, and no other arm calls a gate.
An `else` always keeps the hit, since focus would then choose between two paths.

## `private static bool TAuditFocusCheck(ExpressionSyntax condition)`

True when every control read in an `&&` chain asks only that the control has focus.
A focus read is a listed focus member read on a control.
In a control's type pattern, it is a focus member tested `true`.
Other parts of such a pattern must be type tests alone, so the row is only paired.
Parts that read no control may test anything, since they are not the medium's state.
A negated focus read, an `||` or a carried focus value keeps the hit.

## `private static string? TAuditCaseRead(ExpressionSyntax governing, SyntaxNode label)`

The control a switch label decides on, or null.
A `when` guard that reads a control decides, unless it is a presence test or type tests alone.
Otherwise a control read in the governing expression decides when the label tests its value.
A null label, a discard and a label of type tests alone test no value.
A label whose pattern tests a control's state through a type pattern names the governing expression.

## `private static bool TAuditPairCheck(PatternSyntax pattern)`

True for a pattern of type tests alone, nested property patterns included.
A bare type name parses as a constant pattern, so a constant naming a type is a type test.
`or`, `and`, `not` and parentheses keep a pattern of type tests alone.
Picking a gate by the row's type pairs the row to its record, which a driver may do.
A constant or any other value test in the pattern decides.

## `private static bool TAuditConsoleCheck(InvocationExpressionSyntax call)`

True when the call reads console input.

## `private static string? TAuditDialogRead(ExpressionSyntax condition)`

The first call on a dialog type inside the condition, or null.

## `private static bool TAuditClockCheck(SyntaxNode clock)`

True when the expression, or the object a creation builds, is of one of the clock types.

## `private static bool TAuditDelayCheck(SyntaxNode loop)`

True when a loop waits on a delay member or on a clock.

## `private static bool TAuditLambdaCheck(LambdaExpressionSyntax lambda)`

True for a lambda whose first parameter is a bulletin that is discarded or never read.
The parameter's type decides, so the rule holds for every medium and every observer helper.

## `private static bool TAuditDriveCheck(SyntaxNode handler)`

True when a handler, a callback or a loop requests inline or names a relay.

## `private static string? TAuditDeafRead(MethodDeclarationSyntax handler)`

The name of a bulletin parameter the body never mentions, or null.
