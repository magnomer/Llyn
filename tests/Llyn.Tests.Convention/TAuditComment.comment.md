# TAuditComment.cs
Hash: `c0b91787c44310bd`

## `public sealed class TAuditComment`

Keeps prose in the comment files and out of the sources.
Every rule value comes from `TAuditCommentSetting`, which mirrors scripts/AuditComments.json.
The findings match AuditComments.ps1 on the same tree, in the same order, though neither reads the other.
The hash stamp facts live in `TAuditCommentStamp`.
The scope reads they share live in `TAuditCommentFile`.

## `public void AuditComment_CommentLines_KeepLineRules()`

Reads every comment file under the configured roots, plus those of the listed root-level files.
A blank line is skipped, and a heading loses its `#` marks before it is judged.
Every line must be one sentence, hold at most the configured words, and carry none of the forbidden characters.
A heading counts only its words outside code spans.
Any hit names the file, line, and the rule it breaks.
`TAuditCommentLine` judges each line.

## `public void AuditComment_Sources_CarryNoRemark()`

Scans every audited source and listed root-level file for the comment markers its extension declares.
In `.cs` files, string and character literals are blanked first, so a `//` inside a URL does not count.
Every line of an unclosed block comment counts until the line holding its closer.
Files named in the exempt list are skipped, root-level files too, since the generated registry carries a header.
Every extension with markers is scanned, whether or not it pairs with a comment file.

## `public void AuditComment_Sources_CarryCommentFile()`

Checks every configured source and listed root-level file has its paired comment file beside it.
The source list and generated-file exclusions match the script configuration.

## `public void AuditComment_CommentFiles_HaveSource()`

Every comment file under the roots must be the paired comment file of a source.
A comment file left behind by a deleted or renamed source is otherwise never noticed.

## `public void AuditComment_Headings_NameMembers()`

Every signature heading of a comment file names an identifier its source still holds.
It reads the same comment files as the line rules, so the root-level ones count too.
The source is the code or markup file the comment file sits beside, all of them when several share it.
A heading that is a markup snippet or a file name is left out.
A heading for a member that was renamed or deleted is otherwise never noticed.

## `private static string? TAuditMemberRead(string span)`

The identifier a heading names.
It is the last one before a parameter list, an initializer, a body or a base list.
Type arguments are dropped first.

## `private static readonly string[] TAuditCodeExtensions`

The files a comment file may describe: its stem itself, a source, a markup file or a code-behind.

## `private static readonly Regex TAuditHeadingPattern`

A second-level heading whose whole text is one code span.

## `private static readonly Regex TAuditFilePattern`

A heading that names a file rather than a member.

## `private static readonly Regex TAuditGenericPattern`

One innermost type argument list, dropped until none is left.

## `private static readonly Regex TAuditIdentifierPattern`

One identifier, verbatim or plain.

## `private static string[] TAuditSourceRead(string path, bool code)`

For code, blanks every string and character literal over the whole file before splitting into lines.
Other files split into lines unchanged.
An ordinary string or character literal never crosses a line break.
A verbatim or raw literal spanning lines keeps its line count, so a hit still reports the right line.
