# TAuditTruthSetting.cs
Hash: `ccd18e201dce3ef6`

## `internal static class TAuditTruthSetting`

Hand-written and tracked.
The driver-audit scope, the binder inputs and the handle list live here.
The per-file ceilings live in the ledger named by `TAuditLedgerFile`.
No script writes this file.

## `public const bool TAuditTruthEnforced = true;`

False makes every driver fact a warning that passes.
True fails a fact on any file whose count of a kind stands above its ledger ceiling.

## `public const string TAuditTruthReport = "temp/audit/Custody-{0}.md";`

Where the report lands, with the version in the name.
`temp` is ignored by Git, so a run never dirties the tree.

## `public const string TAuditStateSuffix = "State";`

A field or property whose name ends in this is a state the engine should own.

## `public const string TAuditBulletinType = "LBulletin";`

The engine's notice type.
A handler or lambda taking one and never reading it is a deaf observer, in either medium.

## `public const string TAuditConfiguration = "Debug";`

The build configuration whose output and generated files the binder reads.

## `public const string TAuditReferenceRoot = "src/Llyn.Host";`

The project whose build output carries every package any source references.
Host names every project, so its output holds the packages of both media and of Infrastructure.

## `public const string TAuditConductRoot = "src/Llyn.Conduct";`

The folder whose types are Conduct's.
A driver may hold, implement and reshape them, since Conduct's types stop at the driver.

## `public const string TAuditLedgerFile = "TAuditTruthLedger";`

The ledger holding the ceiling of every kind in every driver file.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditCapsuleInclude`

The `git ls-files` patterns of the Capsule project, which stores Deportment's own state.
A call into it answers a shell value, so Contesting does not search its arguments.
Every reader of `TAuditShellInclude` joins this list to it, so each path is written once.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditShellInclude`

The `git ls-files` patterns of every UI source, both surfaces and both drivers.
A type declared under one of these, or under `TAuditCapsuleInclude`, is UI.
A type declared in Conduct is a gate type, and a type declared under any other source is engine.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditTruthInclude`

The patterns of the driver sources the driver walks audit, Deportment and Demeanor alike.
The surfaces are left to the surface audit, where holding anything is already a hit.

## `public static readonly Dictionary<string, string[]> TAuditTruthInformative`

The kinds that only inform, each with the driver folders it waits on.
Such a kind gates nothing while a listed folder holds no tracked source.
Once every listed folder holds one, the kind fails like any other.
Mismatching waits on Demeanor, since every Deportment reach mismatches while the CUI has no code.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditFrameworkPacks`

The shared frameworks referenced beside the test runtime, so framework types resolve.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditControlBases`

A type deriving from one of these is a GUI control, whose state may not decide a request.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditOrderVerbs`

The collection calls that change an order, which only the engine may decide.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditFillVerbs`

The calls that write into a collection in place.
A `readonly` field filled through one is not a fixture.

## `public const string TAuditRequestPrefix = "LRequest";`

The prefix every request record carries.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditSendRoots`

The tenure calls a request finally goes through.
A member that reaches one, calls a Conduct method or builds a request is a sender.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditClockTypes`

The types that fire on time rather than on a user act.
A clock drives a request through an event, a callback it is built with or a loop waiting on it.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditConsoleInput`

The console calls that carry what the user typed, the CUI's control input.
Each is written as the full name of its declaring type and member.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditDialogTypes`

The types whose answer confirms a request.
A confirm belongs in the gate behind a port, so a dialog answer deciding a request is gatekeeping.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditDelayMembers`

The waits that turn a loop into a clock.

## `public const string TAuditInputBase = "System.Windows.Controls.Control";`

The base type of every control that takes user input.
The laundering walk colours an input member only on a receiver deriving from it.
`TextBox`, `ComboBox` and `ToggleButton` derive from it, while `TextBlock` and `Run` do not.
`AuditUI.json` holds the same name as `truth.inputBase`, copied by hand.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditInputMembers`

The members of a GUI control that carry what the user typed or chose.
Caret and selection positions stay off the list, since a driver keeps caret, focus and placement work.
`AuditUI.json` holds the same list as `truth.inputMembers`, copied by hand.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditFocusMembers`

The members of a GUI control that tell whether the user is at it.
A guard on one of them only asks whose event it is, so the misfiring scan exempts it.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditTruthHandles`

Driver types a driver field may hold as a handle rather than as a value.
A handle is called on and passed on, so the field is skipped before any rule reads it.
A Conduct type is a handle by rule and is never listed.
A type from below Conduct is never a handle, so holding one is a duplicating hit counted in the ledger.
The list is empty now that the veneer helpers take Conduct's atelier, which is a handle by rule.
A type is matched as the binder shows it, with any nullable mark dropped.

## `public static readonly string[] TAuditMoonlightingVerbs`

Query methods that, applied to a value from below Conduct, are moonlighting.
